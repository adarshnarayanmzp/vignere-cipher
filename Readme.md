# Vigenère Cipher Web Application

## Overview

This project is a web application for Vigenère cipher encryption and decryption, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using this classical cryptographic technique.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt plaintext messages using a user-defined keyword.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt ciphertext messages back into plaintext using the same keyword.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Stylish and responsive design created with Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the Vigenère cipher algorithm and handling user interactions.
- **Bootstrap:** For a responsive and visually appealing design.
